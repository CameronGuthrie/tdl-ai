## Description
The **To-Do-List Web App** is a simple and interactive task management application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it stores tasks locally in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to provide users with a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for organizing their tasks. It is ideal for personal use, helping users stay productive and keep track of their to-do items.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks into a text box and add them to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Clicking on a task toggles a strikethrough effect, marking it as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they remain available even after the page is reloaded.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

2. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough effect).
